# Simple Feedback Service

This is simple Asp.Net Core application to gather feedback. Users can register application that will send feedback and they can list read the feedback from the simple UI.

This is still work in progress...



# Current status

Authentication and authorization is missing. Feedback is really rudimentary. Must make it possible to redirect to feedback form with client id and then also redirect back. Users should also be able to add more comments on feedback.

Send notifications to users when feedback arrives. Limit user's ability to see only feedback that is assigned to him.
